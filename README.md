# Message-Display
**Clock Divider:\
**Module created to create a delay visible to the human eye. The board I used De10-Lite has a 50Mhz clock. \
The clock divider helped to get it from 50Mhz to 1Hz, which is seen by the human Eye. \
Message Storage:\
Module created to store the message statically to a ROM. The message format was in ASCII\
ASCII Decoder:\
Module created to manually map the ASCII value to a binary pattern for the 7-segment display.\
Still in progress, goal is to mimic a moving message using custom parts of the 7 segement display.
